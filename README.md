Mohammad Hammoud and I also ututilized different methods in order to stay in touch and be able to view each others changes, as well know what the other was doing.
These methods mainly consisted of meeting up together whether it be in university or in our houses, since we dont live that afar apart.
We also used Trello, which is similar to an online to-do list common between us to do divide the work and be able to tract it properly.

However, we did come accross some problems we were unable to solve simply because we didnt know what to do in those cases:
They included setting up the online database and webiste, which presented some bugs we could not explain

In addition, writing codes on visual studio code, though organized, where the same css code when taken from the main method to the style sheet renered it useless.

Finally, some queries decide to stop working automatically at a specific loop, which we were unable to explain.

in th zip file i also inlcuded pictures of treello and the github to show how we were defining the work.

Comments were placed on the codes immediately.
